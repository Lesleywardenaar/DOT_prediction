    "## Pushshift API Reddit comment scraper\n",
    "In this notebook we will scrape Reddit comments from Pushshift's API, Pushshift is a database for social media and is particularly known for having a broad Reddit database. Pushshift's API is more popular for scraping larger amounts of data, while Reddit's API restricts the scraping per time period and such makes it impossible to scrape all data from a larger time period. For more information about Pushshift, the database and the API, check out their website (https://pushshift.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will consist out of iteratively requesting comment data from the subreddit's Dot and Polkadot, the two most popular subreddit's about Polkadot with a each having around 17k members at the time of writing. The API returns all the newest comments ascendingly from a the 'after date', specified in the link. A following request will take the date from the most recent scraped post and add this to the request. In this way the API returns all post between a timeframe without repition. From the requested data, we will extract the usefull features and save that to a df. For every month of data, the df will be saved to a csv file iteratively, this continues until the last request will return a comment that exceeds the threshold date. The scraped data will contain data between 18-08-2020 (23:00 UTC) to 18-02-2021 (23:59 UTC).\n"
